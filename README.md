# Yugioh Cards

An Android Compose Application with the latest libraries and **Jetpack Compose** to practice and learn.
You can find proper implementations of listed libs in the project.

Yugioh is an anime from my childhood; basically, itâ€™s a card game. So I found an API for it and presented it in a friendly way.
